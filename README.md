# Python_contact_book_app
Simple contact book management application written in python.
This application is intentionally written without the use of any python libraries as an exercise for expanding my knowledge and practice in python.

Usage:  In its current state the code is not as useful as it could be.  The code can be copied and utilized with file functions to save existing contact data or simply used as a reference to enhance other projects.

The code includes methods store, modify and view contacts.  Each contact is stored in a dictionary of dictionaries.

Each contact stores:
First Name
Last Name
Phone Number
Email Address

The user is greeted with a welcome screen and the following functions:
Create a new contact
Search for a contact
Update an existing contact
View all contacts
Delete a contact
Exit contact app

Thank you for viewing!
